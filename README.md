= Prisma Cloud Docs

Welcome to the docs project for Prisma Cloud.
Docs are a core part of the product and we build them just like we build the software in it - using modern collaboration platforms like GitHub and publishing them with a CI/CD pipeline.
As of May 2020, we've open sourced the docs so that anyone can contribute directly to them and see their work quickly go live for the whole community's benefit.
This repo is where that happens.
